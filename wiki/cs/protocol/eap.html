<p>
 EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP
   provides its own support for duplicate elimination and
   retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.
   Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual
   EAP methods may support this.
</p>
   
<p>
 EAP encapsulation on IEEE 802 wired media is described in [IEEE-802.1X],
   and encapsulation on IEEE wireless LANs in [IEEE-802.11i]
</p>
   
<p>
The EAP authentication exchange proceeds as follows:
</p>
<pre>
[1] The authenticator sends a Request to authenticate the peer.  The
       Request has a Type field to indicate what is being requested.
       Examples of Request Types include Identity, MD5-challenge, etc.
       The MD5-challenge Type corresponds closely to the CHAP
       authentication protocol [RFC1994].  Typically, the authenticator
       will send an initial Identity Request; however, an initial
       Identity Request is not required, and MAY be bypassed.  For
       example, the identity may not be required where it is determined
       by the port to which the peer has connected (leased lines,
         dedicated switch or dial-up ports), or where the identity is
       obtained in another fashion (via calling station identity or MAC
       address, in the Name field of the MD5-Challenge Response, etc.).

   [2] The peer sends a Response packet in reply to a valid Request.  As
       with the Request packet, the Response packet contains a Type
       field, which corresponds to the Type field of the Request.

   [3] The authenticator sends an additional Request packet, and the
       peer replies with a Response.  The sequence of Requests and
       Responses continues as long as needed.  EAP is a 'lock step'
       protocol, so that other than the initial Request, a new Request
       cannot be sent prior to receiving a valid Response.  The
       authenticator is responsible for retransmitting requests as
       described in Section 4.1.  After a suitable number of
       retransmissions, the authenticator SHOULD end the EAP
       conversation.  The authenticator MUST NOT send a Success or
       Failure packet when retransmitting or when it fails to get a
       response from the peer.

   [4] The conversation continues until the authenticator cannot
       authenticate the peer (unacceptable Responses to one or more
       Requests), in which case the authenticator implementation MUST
       transmit an EAP Failure (Code 4).  Alternatively, the
       authentication conversation can continue until the authenticator
       determines that successful authentication has occurred, in which
       case the authenticator MUST transmit an EAP Success (Code 3).

</pre>

<p>
Advantages:
</p>
<pre>
 o  The EAP protocol can support multiple authentication mechanisms
      without having to pre-negotiate a particular one.

   o  Network Access Server (NAS) devices (e.g., a switch or access
      point) do not have to understand each authentication method and
      MAY act as a pass-through agent for a backend authentication
      server.  Support for pass-through is optional.  An authenticator
      MAY authenticate local peers, while at the same time acting as a
      pass-through for non-local peers and authentication methods it
      does not implement locally.

   o  Separation of the authenticator from the backend authentication
      server simplifies credentials management and policy decision
      making.
</pre>


<pre>
An EAP conversation MAY utilize a sequence of methods.  A common
   example of this is an Identity request followed by a single EAP
   authentication method such as an MD5-Challenge.  However, the peer
   and authenticator MUST utilize only one authentication method (Type 4
   or greater) within an EAP conversation, after which the authenticator
   MUST send a Success or Failure packet.
