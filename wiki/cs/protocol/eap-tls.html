<pre>
 From this point forward, while nominally the EAP conversation occurs
   between the EAP authenticator and the peer, the authenticator MAY act
   as a pass-through device, with the EAP packets received from the peer
   being encapsulated for transmission to a backend authentication
   server. 
</pre>

<pre>
Once having received the peer's Identity, the EAP server MUST respond
   with an EAP-TLS/Start packet, which is an EAP-Request packet with
   EAP-Type=EAP-TLS, the Start (S) bit set, and no data.  The EAP-TLS
   conversation will then begin, with the peer sending an EAP-Response
   packet with EAP-Type=EAP-TLS.  The data field of that packet will
   encapsulate one or more TLS records in TLS record layer format,
   containing a TLS client_hello handshake message.  The current cipher
   spec for the TLS records will be TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL and null

   compression.  This current cipher spec remains the same until the
   change_cipher_spec message signals that subsequent records will have
   the negotiated attributes for the remainder of the handshake.

   The client_hello message contains the peer's TLS version number, a
   sessionId, a random number, and a set of ciphersuites supported by
   the peer.  The version offered by the peer MUST correspond to TLS
   v1.0 or later.

   The EAP server will then respond with an EAP-Request packet with
   EAP-Type=EAP-TLS.  The data field of this packet will encapsulate one
   or more TLS records.  These will contain a TLS server_hello handshake
   message, possibly followed by TLS certificate, server_key_exchange,
   certificate_request, server_hello_done and/or finished handshake
   messages, and/or a TLS change_cipher_spec message.  The server_hello
   handshake message contains a TLS version number, another random
   number, a sessionId, and a ciphersuite.  The version offered by the
   server MUST correspond to TLS v1.0 or later.

   If the peer's sessionId is null or unrecognized by the server, the
   server MUST choose the sessionId to establish a new session.
   Otherwise, the sessionId will match that offered by the peer,
   indicating a resumption of the previously established session with
   that sessionId.  The server will also choose a ciphersuite from those
   offered by the peer.  If the session matches the peer's, then the
   ciphersuite MUST match the one negotiated during the handshake
   protocol execution that established the session.

   If the EAP server is not resuming a previously established session,
   then it MUST include a TLS server_certificate handshake message, and
   a server_hello_done handshake message MUST be the last handshake
   message encapsulated in this EAP-Request packet.

   The certificate message contains a public key certificate chain for
   either a key exchange public key (such as an RSA or Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange public key) or a signature public key (such as an RSA or
   Digital Signature Standard (DSS) signature public key).  In the
   latter case, a TLS server_key_exchange handshake message MUST also be
   included to allow the key exchange to take place.

   The certificate_request message is included when the server desires
   the peer to authenticate itself via public key.  While the EAP server
   SHOULD require peer authentication, this is not mandatory, since
   there are circumstances in which peer authentication will not be
   needed (e.g., emergency services, as described in [UNAUTH]), or where
   the peer will authenticate via some other means.

   If the peer supports EAP-TLS and is configured to use it, it MUST
   respond to the EAP-Request with an EAP-Response packet of EAP-
   Type=EAP-TLS.  If the preceding server_hello message sent by the EAP
   server in the preceding EAP-Request packet did not indicate the
   resumption of a previous session, the data field of this packet MUST
   encapsulate one or more TLS records containing a TLS
   client_key_exchange, change_cipher_spec, and finished messages.  If
   the EAP server sent a certificate_request message in the preceding
   EAP-Request packet, then unless the peer is configured for privacy
   (see Section 2.1.4) the peer MUST send, in addition, certificate and
   certificate_verify messages.  The former contains a certificate for
   the peer's signature public key, while the latter contains the peer's
   signed authentication response to the EAP server.  After receiving

 this packet, the EAP server will verify the peer's certificate and
   digital signature, if requested.

   If the preceding server_hello message sent by the EAP server in the
   preceding EAP-Request packet indicated the resumption of a previous
   session, then the peer MUST send only the change_cipher_spec and
   finished handshake messages.  The finished message contains the
   peer's authentication response to the EAP server.

   In the case where the EAP-TLS mutual authentication is successful,
   the conversation will appear as follows:
